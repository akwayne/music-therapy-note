### A Music Therapist's Planning Resource

Therapy Notes is a project made with Flask that uses a SQLite database to store music uploaded by its users.

## Purpose
In my work as a music therapist, I wanted a way to store and organize music that I had found for my clients as well as be able to quickly search for what I needed when lesson planning. What if I could narrow my search by the age group that I was working with or a specific goal that I wanted to address (e.g. social skills or sensory regulation)?

## How to Use
**Search** for songs by title or artist, or search by any number of relevant tags. Or combine both search types to find exactly what you are looking for.

**Upload** songs and add any number of tags describing the song's appropriateness with a given age group, therapy goal, or music genre. Users can also include files or links that would help others find more information about the song or learn how to play it.

**Save** songs to a personal Library for future use. After finding the right music for their clients, a music therapist can keep their favorites in one place.
